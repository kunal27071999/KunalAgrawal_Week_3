"""
Operator Overloading means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined 
operational meaning. For example operator + is used to add two integers as
 well as join two strings and merge two lists. It is achievable because ‘+’
  operator is overloaded by int class and str class. You might have noticed
   that the same built-in operator or function shows different behavior for
    objects of different classes, this is called Operator Overloading.

In any object-oriented programming language, Overriding is a feature that allows
a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that
 is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a
method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature, and same
 return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in
  the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.

Method overriding is an ability of any object-oriented programming language that 
allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that 
is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a method in a 
subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type)
 as a method in its super-class,
 then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.
