2. Write note on Exceptions 

"""

"""
Exceptions: Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct
but the code resulted in an error. This error does not stop the execution of
the program, however, it changes the normal flow of the program.

Example:


# initialize the amount variable
marks = 10000

# perform division with 0
a = marks / 0
print(a)
