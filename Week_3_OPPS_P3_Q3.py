"""
In any object-oriented programming language, Overriding is a feature that allows
a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that
 is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a
method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature, and same
 return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in
  the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.
