Syntax errors

Python will find these kinds of errors when it tries to parse your program, and exit with an error message without running anything. Syntax errors are like spelling or grammar mistakes in a language like English.

Runtime errors

If a program is free of syntax errors, it will be run by the Python interpreter. However, the program may exit if it encounters a runtime error – a problem that went undetected when the program was parsed, but is only revealed when the code is executed.

Some examples of Python Runtime errors −

 

division by zero
performing an operation on incompatible types
using an identifier which has not been defined
accessing a list element, dictionary value or object attribute which doesn’t exist
trying to access a file which doesn’t exist
